# ðŸ¦™ðŸ“š **LlamaIndex - Chat with My Custom Chatbot**

This project builds a personalized chatbot powered by LlamaIndex, a powerful tool for indexing and retrieving information. It leverages the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and augments it with my professional data, allowing you to have informative conversations about my work experience.

3. Obtain an OpenAI API Key:
   - Visit [OpenAI API Key Guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key) and create a new secret key.
   - Store the key securely in the Streamlit workspace (not in the repository).

4. Create a Streamlit account:
